        HSX is a syntax extension for Haskell that allows you to 
        write HTML-like code directly within Haskell source files. 
        It is commonly used in web development frameworks like Yesod
         and Reflex-DOM to create user interfaces in a more declarative manner.

    <h2>Benefits of Using HSX</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Readability:</strong> HSX syntax closely resembles HTML, making it easier for developers to understand the structure of the UI.</li>
            <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Since HSX is integrated with Haskell, it benefits from Haskell's strong type system, reducing runtime errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> HSX allows seamless integration of Haskell code within HTML-like structures, enabling dynamic content generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> The declarative nature of HSX makes it easier to maintain and update UI components.</li>
        </ul>
